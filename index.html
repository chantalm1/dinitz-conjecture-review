         <p>This is a guide for people who want to learn how to understand a primary research paper in math, specifically in the area of graph theory, one of the more accessible areas of math.  If that is the case, this is the guide for you!  This guide covers the background needed to understand the proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitz_conjecture">Dinitz conjecture</a>.  The way I would suggest using this guide is to first give a look through of Galvin's succinct <a href="https://kostochk.web.illinois.edu/math581/galvin.pdf">proof</a>.  Pending any confusions from the reader, reading the "Definitions" and "Beginner problems" sections of this guide will aid in clarifying definitions and quizzing oneself on the way in which they are to be used, aiding in gaining foundation to make the paper easy-reading for anyone! After these two sections are covered to one's liking, the "Problems" section covers some harder questions as well as how to interpret the two main results in the paper. Once the reader has covered these three sections, they will be well equipped to read through this succinct paper.</p>

You can prove this by showing that on a fully connected graph of more than 2 vertices it is possible to direct the edges such that no vertex has an indegree of $n - 1$. This simple to show as suppose that we select any vertex v in the graph, and have at least one edge be outgoing from the vertex, leaving a nonzero number of edges going into the vertex. For any other vertex in the graph, it will be missing an incoming edge from vertex $v$, so no kernel exists in the graph."

Removing any vertex v from the graph won't cause the clique C it is part of to not have a kernel anymore (because C will continue to be a clique, and the definition of a normal graph is that *every* clique has a kernel, so this includes C with v removed).  Removing a vertex from the graph won't *introduce* any more cliques either because no edges are added to the graph that could change non cliques to cliques."

               answer="Flower snark:
               Every orientation has a clique of number of vertices at most 2, and for cliques of size 2 or less the edges can be directed in any way and the clique can still have a kernel--so if we can show that for any orientation of this graph, no kernel exists, we will have disproved that it is solvable. It's easiest to work with the second picture, and simply direct the arrows in a circle. So all edges from pink to blue are directed with the tail at pink and head at blue, tail at blue and head at green and so on.  This way, there is no way to choose an independent set where all the vertices outside of that set have an edge to at least one vertex in that independent set. We are forced to pick all the vertices in the graph and that does not form an independent set." answer-attachments="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Graph_homomorphism_into_C5.svg/260px-Graph_homomorphism_into_C5.svg.png"

This is a normal orientation for the graph--the four affected edges, two black and two pink, are edges within exactly one clique of size 3 (and of course the trivial cliques consisting of an edge), and each have a kernel consisting of T.

               question="How can Dinitz' conjecture be reframed using some or all combination of the terms: (f:g)-choosability, chromatic number, chromatic index?"
               answer="Dinitz' conjecture is: 'Is it true, that for any graph $D$ where there are $n^2$ vertices are laid out as grid points on a square, and for any vertex in row $i$ column $j$, $v_{ij}$ has edges to every $v_{kj}$ and $v_{il}$ for every $k,l$ in the set ${1..n}$ excluding $i$ and $j$, respectively, and a random subset $C_{sub_v}$ sized $n$, drawn out of a constant $m$ sized set (where $m \ge n$) of colors, it is possible to choose a color $c_v$ and assign it to $v$, out of each $C_{sub_v}$, such that $D$ is colorable using the set formed by the set of $c_v$?'
               Since $D$ can be also seen as any orientation of the line graph of the bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$, if we were to show that $D$ is n-choosable (aka (f:g)-choosable for constant functions f and g assigning $n$ and 1 to each vertex, respectively), then we will have proven the Dinitz conjecture. This is because if we can show that out of an *infinite number of colors*, drawing $n$ colors randomly and assigning to each vertex of $D$ and showing a vertex can be selected out of each of the lists in a graph colorable way, then we will have *immediately* shown this result for drawing $n$ colors out of $m$ colors where $m \ge n$."

We can show inductively on the node number, that if the first i nodes all have different colors, we must select a color distinct from the first i for the i+1 st node. Now that you have shown it is possible to color a fully connected graph of n nodes with n colors, then if you see the line graph of $K_{n,n}$, n as an $n \times n$ grid, just displace the next row’s colors by 1, and keep doing for each row.

         <p>Lemma 2.1 is essential in proving the Dinitz conjecture in Galvin's paper.  Lemma 2.1 in Galvin's paper states: "Let \(D\) be a digraph in which every induced subdigraph has a kernel.  If \(f,g : V(D) \to \mathbb{N}\) are such that \(f(v) \ge \sum_{u \in N[v]} g(u)\) whenever \(g(v) > 0\), then \(D\) is (f:g)-choosable". Below is the body of the proof and some exercises based on it to exercise your thinking!</p>
         <p>Let \(V = V(D)\). We use induction on \(\sum_{v \in V} g(v)\). Let \(W = \{v \in V: g(v) > 0\}\). Let sets \(A_v\) (for \(v \in V\) with \(|A_v| = f(v)\) be given. Choose any \(c\) in \(C = \cup_{v \in W} A_v\).  Let \(S = {v \in W: c \in A_v}\). Let \(K\) be a kernel of \(S\).  Define \(g': V \to \mathbb{N}\) by setting \(g'(v) = g(v) - 1\) for \(v \in K\), and \(g'(v) = g(v)\) for \(v \notin K\), and let \(f'(v) = |A_v\setminus\{c\}|\).  Then \(\sum_{v \in V} g'(v) < \sum_{v \in V} g(v)\) and \(f'(v) \ge \sum_{u \in N[v]} g'(u)\) whenever \(g'(v) > 0\). By the induction hypothesis, \(D\) is (f':g')-choosable.  Thus there are sets \(B'_u\) and \(B'_v\) that are subsets of \(A_u\setminus\{c\}\) and \(A_v\setminus\{c\}\), respectively, such that for any \(u\) and \(v\) that share an edge, \(B'_u \cap B'_v\) is empty.  If we can show that adding back a color to the appropriate \(B'\) sets will result in every \(v\) being assigned a subset \(B'_v\) that has size \(g(v)\) and is a subset of \(A_v\), then we will have shown that \(D\) is (f:g)-choosable.  Define sets \(B_v\) by setting \(B_v = B'_v \cup \{c\}\) if \(v \in K\), and \(B_v = B'_v\) otherwise.  Then \(|B_v| = g(v)\) for every \(v \in V\), and \(B_u \cap B_v\) is empty if \(u\) and \(v\) share an edge.</p>

If $v \in K$, and $g'(v) > 0$, then  $\sum_{u \in N[v]} (g(u) - g'(u)) = 1$, as no vertices in the kernel have edges to each other so the only $u \in N[v]$ where $g'(u) = g(u) - 1$ is when $u = v$ (as $N[v]$ is the *closed neighborhood* of $v$, namely, it includes $v$). $f(v) - f'(v) = 1$ as well given the type of vertex $v$ is. So $f'(v) >= \sum_{u \in N[v]} g'(u)$.  If $v \notin in K$ but is in $S$, and $g'(v) > 0$, then $f'(v) = f(v) - 1$ as well, but the amount that $\sum_{u \in N[v]} g(u)$ differs from $$\sum_{u \in N[v]} g'(u)$$ is the size of $K$, which we have shown in an earlier card in this set to be at least 1.

Further, none of the $B'$ sets assigned to any of the vertices in the graph as per the induction hypothesis, contain $c$ (as we defined $f'(v) = |A_v\setminus\{c\}|$ and used this size to draw $B'$ sets from).  So as none of the vertices in $K$ share an edge, we can add back $c$ to each $B'_v$ only if $v \in K$.  "

         Now try giving the paper another look and see if the below makes sense regarding how to prove the main result of the paper!
         <p>The result of "every line graph of a multigraph is solvable iff it is perfect" is used as the first step to prove the Dinitz conjecture. It is shown in an earlier result (which is one of my open questions/areas to explore, that is clearly explained in that is covered in Maffray's paper), that the line graph of the bipartite graph \(K_{n,n}\), is perfect. The statement "every line graph of a multigraph is perfect" is equivalent to 
         <ul>
            <li>"every perfect line graph is solvable" (by Maffray's theorem)
            <li>"every line graph of a multigraph has the property that every induced subgraph is solvable"  (this is by the fact that "every induced subgraph of a solvable graph G, is solvable", which is an <a href="#induced-subgraph-solvable">open question</a> of mine)</li>
            <li>"every line graph of a multigraph has the property that every induced subgraph's normal orientations contain a kernel" (definition of solvable)</li>
            <li>"if D is a normal orientation of the line graph of \(K_{n,n}\), then as the underlying graph of D is solvable, every induced subgraph of D contains a kernel"  (this is by "every induced subgraph of a normal graph, is normal" and by the definition of solvable that states that "every normal orientation contains a kernel"--collectively these two statements imply that every induced subgraph of D is normal, and thus has a kernel)</li>
         </ul>
         Then, as can be seen in Theorem 4.1 in the paper, we can very cleverly choose a particular orientation D of the line graph of \(K_{n,n}\) for which it is convenient to show that D is normal, show that D has the property that the maximum outdegree for any vertex in D is n - 1, and invoke Lemma 2.1 to show that D is n-choosable.  Note that by showing that *any particular orientation* of the line graph of \(K_{n,n}\) is n-choosable, we will have proved Dinitz' conjecture--this is because the definition of n-choosable invokes the property of two vertices sharing an edge in *any particular direction*. </p>

                     We will consider the set of normal orientations on a graph missing any particular vertex \(v\) from \(G\) (with all the incident edges to \(v\) removed as well), and show that for every element in this set, the normal orientation \(N\) contains a kernel. Thus we will have shown that removing any \(v\) will result in a solvable subgraph, and we can extend this process recursively by removing any number of vertices. There are two cases on the type of \(N\), and below each case is the intermediate result used to prove the case:
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           1) there exists a normal orientation \(M\) of \(G\) such that removing \(v\) results in \(N\).
                           <ul>
                              <li>Show (or disprove) that every normal graph \(G\) with a kernel \(K\), where if any vertex is deleted and the graph continues to be normal, that this graph will continue to have a kernel.</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           2) there exists a non normal orientation \(M\) of \(G\) such that removing \(v\) results in \(N\). 
                           <ul>
                              <li>Show (or disprove) that every non normal orientation N of a solvable graph \(G\), where if any vertex is deleted from \(N\) and the graph becomes normal, that \(N\) will have a kernel.</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Why is the &quot;stable marriage theorem&quot; able to be restated as the line graph of \(K_{n,n}\) is solvable?</li>
